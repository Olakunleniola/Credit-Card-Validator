## Credit Card Validator Project 

## Overview
This project was completed during my Codecademy bootcamp and focuses on creating a Credit Card Validator. Unlike previous tutorials, this project presents a series of open-ended requirements to be fulfilled. You'll have the flexibility to explore various solutions, use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when encountering challenges.

## Project Goals
**Context**

The project places you in the role of a clerk working for a company suspicious that credit card distributors may be mailing out cards with invalid numbers. As the designated clerk, your task is to optimize the verification process for credit cards. While every other clerk relies on pencil and paper, you have the opportunity to use your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards simultaneously. Enjoy the advantage of optimizing the verification process and, as a result, have more time to relax!

## Running the Program
- Download the project files through your local terminal by running the command below: 
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Olakunleniola/Credit-Card-Validator.git
    ```

+ Navigate to the project folder and run the command below
    
    ```bash
